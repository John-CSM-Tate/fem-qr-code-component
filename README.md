## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- I used git and github for first time on a project.
- Learned that a height needs to be set for the body to be able to flex align-items vertically.

```css
body {
    min-height: 100vh;
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
}
```
